# Wallet Integration

AfroPay Stellar supports Stellar-compatible wallets for authentication and transactions.

Example features:

* Wallet connection
* Transaction signing
* Balance tracking
* Payment confirmation

---

# Core Payment Flow

3. User selects amount and currency
4. Stellar processes transaction
5. Transaction is confirmed on-chain
6. User tracks payment status

---

# Stellar Integration

AfroPay Stellar uses Stellar because it provides:

* Fast transaction finality
* Extremely low fees
* Scalable payment infrastructure
* Energy-efficient blockchain operations

The platform also explores Soroban smart contracts for:

* Payment automation
* Transaction verification
* Advanced remittance logic

---

# UI/UX Design System

The application follows a modern Web3 fintech design approach:

* Dark mode first
* Glassmorphism
* Responsive layouts
* Smooth animations
* Fintech dashboard aesthetics

---

# Development Guidelines

* Use TypeScript
* Follow reusable component architecture
* Keep functions modular
* Maintain clean folder structure
* Write readable and maintainable code

---

# Security

Never expose:

* Private keys
* Secret environment variables
* Sensitive wallet credentials

Always validate blockchain transactions before submission.

---

# Future Roadmap

* Multi-currency support
* Merchant payment tools
* Mobile wallet application
* Soroban smart contract automation
* Fiat on/off ramps
* Payment APIs
* Business remittance infrastructure

## DevOps & Container Resiliency

### Restart Policies
All application services utilize the `unless-stopped` restart policy. In the event of an unhandled runtime error, transient infrastructure failure, or container crash, Docker Engine will automatically attempt to reboot the container unless it was explicitly brought down via `docker compose down`.

### Health Checking & Boot Ordering
Container startup orchestration is verified using explicit healthchecks rather than network binding readiness:
* **Databases (`postgres`, `redis`)** utilize native CLI commands (`pg_isready` and `redis-cli ping`) to declare deep readiness.
* **Service Layers (`api`, `frontend`, `fraud-service`)** expose health/routing endpoints validated via `curl`.
* **Ordering**: Core dependencies utilize advanced `depends_on` rules requiring structural health indicators (`condition: service_healthy`) before booting downstream application layers. This prevents application services from crashing due to early database connection rejections during initial startup sequences.
